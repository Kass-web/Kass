# Fake news elimination


## Summary

A study was made recently that presented an interesting finding, only 49% percent of people who come across news online think that the news source is trustworthy. If the credibility of news is so abysmal, how can we determine signal from noise and act upon the information we see provided by different news outlets? To further exarcebate this issue, fake news is an ever increasing problem. Trust but verify (Our solution), is an AI based extension solution that attempts to combat the spread of fake news by evluating the credibility of news by cross-referencing a given news piece. 


## Background

Our solution attempts to initially tailor to financial institutioins, because people within that domain have to make decisions that have very significant and long lasting ramifications. The problem we aim to solve is to help financial institutions & financial service providers decrease the likelihood of making decisions based on fake news. The problem could be seen as rather frequent and this topic is of extreme importance.



## How is it used?

Our solution is a Extension based solution that is downloaded in to a given browser, the end user simply installs the plugin / extension and by doing so is able to acquire credibility data of a given news outlet whenever visiting one. The users are individuas who represent financial insitutioins or other financial professionals. 


## Data sources and AI methods
The data is acquired by our AI, however initially we will have to manually install certain parameters. The initial parameters are for example a set amount of most popular and frequently utilized web sources of financial professionals. As more and more financial professionals begin to use the solution it is going feed the AI exponentially due to the flywheel phenomen.


## Challenges

Our solution does not solve the need for empowered decision making itself, as it only acts as an guide to decision making. When it comes to any possible ethical considerations, i would argue there is none. 


## What next?

Of course, what would be needed for growth is initial seed capital, after which heavy emphasis on marketing of the solution to financial instituions.
